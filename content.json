    "title": "The Big Context Picture",
    "summary": "**Every major tech company now has multiple AI models**, and they're in an arms race. The chart tracks 22 different models across 5 companies as of August 2025. These are the same AI systems that power ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and other assistants you might use.\n",
    "fullDescription": "## What This Chart Shows You\n\nThink of this as a **menu of the most powerful AI assistants** available today - like comparing the latest smartphones, but for AI chatbots and coding assistants.\n\n\n### What the Numbers Mean\n\n**Context Window** = How much text the AI can \"remember\" in a single conversation\n- **128k tokens** ‚âà A short novel (about 100,000 words)\n- **200k tokens** ‚âà Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\n- **400k tokens** ‚âà The entire Lord of the Rings trilogy  \n- **1M tokens** ‚âà About 10 novels or 800,000 words\n- **10M tokens** ‚âà An entire library shelf\n\nBigger context = the AI can work with longer documents, remember more of your conversation, and handle complex projects better.\n\n### Key Takeaways\n\n1. **OpenAI (ChatGPT)** has the newest GPT-5 with 400,000 token memory - a huge upgrade from earlier versions\n\n2. **Google's Gemini 2.5** models all have massive 1 million token contexts - they can read entire codebases or book series\n\n3. **The verification badges matter** - Green means the specs are accurate, yellow means the marketing doesn't match reality (looking at you, Grok 3), and orange means users are reporting problems\n\n4. **Not all claims are true** - xAI claims Grok 3 has 1 million token memory, but it actually caps at 131,000. Meta's Llama 4 supposedly beats everyone on benchmarks but users say it performs poorly.\n\n5. **These are all available now** - If you're using ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or other AI tools, you're likely using one of these models.\n\n### Why This Matters\n\nIf you're choosing an AI assistant for work or personal use, this chart helps you understand what you're actually getting versus what's being advertised. It's like a consumer reports guide for AI - cutting through marketing hype to show real capabilities.\n\nThe rapid evolution (GPT-5 and Claude 4 didn't exist 6 months ago!) shows how fast this technology is advancing. What required a supercomputer five years ago now runs on your phone.",
