      "title": "The Big Context Picture",
      "summary": "**Every major tech company now has multiple AI models**, and they're in an arms race. The chart tracks 22 different models across 5 companies as of August 2025. These are the same AI systems that power ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and other assistants you might use.\n",
      "fullDescription": "## What This Chart Shows You\n\nThink of this as a **menu of the most powerful AI assistants** available today - like comparing the latest smartphones, but for AI chatbots and coding assistants.\n\n\n### What the Numbers Mean\n\n**Context Window** = How much text the AI can \"remember\" in a single conversation\n- **128k tokens** ‚âà A short novel (about 100,000 words)\n- **200k tokens** ‚âà Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\n- **400k tokens** ‚âà The entire Lord of the Rings trilogy  \n- **1M tokens** ‚âà About 10 novels or 800,000 words\n- **10M tokens** ‚âà An entire library shelf\n\nBigger context = the AI can work with longer documents, remember more of your conversation, and handle complex projects better.\n\n### Key Takeaways\n\n1. **OpenAI (ChatGPT)** has the newest GPT-5 with 400,000 token memory - a huge upgrade from earlier versions\n\n2. **Google's Gemini 2.5** models all have massive 1 million token contexts - they can read entire codebases or book series\n\n3. **The verification badges matter** - Green means the specs are accurate, yellow means the marketing doesn't match reality (looking at you, Grok 3), and orange means users are reporting problems\n\n4. **Not all claims are true** - xAI claims Grok 3 has 1 million token memory, but it actually caps at 131,000. Meta's Llama 4 supposedly beats everyone on benchmarks but users say it performs poorly.\n\n5. **These are all available now** - If you're using ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or other AI tools, you're likely using one of these models.\n\n### Why This Matters\n\nIf you're choosing an AI assistant for work or personal use, this chart helps you understand what you're actually getting versus what's being advertised. It's like a consumer reports guide for AI - cutting through marketing hype to show real capabilities.\n\nThe rapid evolution (GPT-5 and Claude 4 didn't exist 6 months ago!) shows how fast this technology is advancing. What required a supercomputer five years ago now runs on your phone.",

      "summary": "The Scrum Timer is a tool designed to help teams run better daily stand-up meetings. It goes beyond a simple stopwatch by allowing a facilitator to not only track time but also to capture real-time observations about how the meeting is going.\n",
      "fullDescription": "**Key Features** \n\n- Speaking Timer: A classic analog and digital timer tracks the overall meeting time and the speaking time for each individual attendee.\n\n- Observational Tagging: This is the core of the app. Instead of just taking notes, a facilitator can quickly \"tag\" participants with predefined behaviors. These tags are organized by role (like Product Owner or Scrum Master) and help identify positive patterns to reinforce and negative patterns to discuss later.\n\n- Customizable Roles: You can assign specific roles (like Product Owner, Scrum Master, etc.) to attendees. This ensures that the tags you apply are relevant to their function on the team. You can even assign multiple roles to one person.\n\n- Integrated Workspace: A built-in workspace allows the facilitator to take free-form notes using Markdown and manage a list of action items directly within the app.\n\n- Meeting Summary: At the end of the meeting, the app generates a complete summary‚Äîincluding speaking times, all observational tags, notes, and action items‚Äîthat can be easily copied and pasted into team chats or documentation.",
